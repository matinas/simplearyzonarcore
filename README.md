# simplearyzonarcore

The project includes two scenes:
1. **AryzoneHelloAR:** this is the HelloAR ARCore sample project modified to work with the Aryzon SDK
2. **Cubes:** this is a simple scene that shows a cube anchored to the floor (or whatever other planar surface it detects) using ARCore and allows to interact with it based on gaze on the Aryzon AR headset
